# 👋 Hi there

👨‍💻 I'm Igor, a passionate **software engineer** currently working at https://rossum.ai/.

🧰 I specialize in building **reliable, scalable and performant web applications** using Python, Flask/FastAPI, Kubernetes, and AWS.

🔒 In the past, I've delved into **ethical hacking**, focusing on web and mobile apps as well as infrastructure. This experience has given me a unique perspective on security and robust application design.

🚀 I believe in **high ownership** and take pride in my ability to adapt to (almost) any work environment. I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn new things. I find that I learn best by doing, rather than just reading.

🌟 My goal is to create **impactful** software solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out!
